Android will need Permissions. - I tried to model this after React Native\'s AsyncStorage. Main thing is that you no longer need to do JSON.stringify and JSON.parse when you set/get. Not sure why they make you do that to begin with... but you can set/get an JSONable item using this module. - All methods return a promise. So make sure to make your functions async. - iOS\'s data is securely sandboxed within your app group. I couldn\'t find something as easy to access, or that wouldn\'t be deleted if you delete an app, so the Android version saves a json file to the android device\'s external storage. This is good because if the app is deleted, another app can still access the data. But this is bad because any other app can delete/edit/access this file. For this reason, at least for Android, do not store data in it that is sensitive. If you\'re saving user preferences, fine. But do not save something like credit card numbers or anything like that in here. That would be irresponsible. The file is saved to the user\'s storage in the following format: ```$storage/$appGroupIdentifier/data.json```. So make sure your appGroupIdentifier is a valid folder name. Reverse dns works fine.","topics":["react-native"],"license":{"name":"MIT License","url":"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz","key":"mit","spdxId":"MIT"},"hasTypes":false,"newArchitecture":false},"images":[],"npmPkg":"react-native-shared-group-preferences","npm":{"downloads":67034,"start":"2024-04-24","end":"2024-05-23","period":"month","weekDownloads":15154},"score":38,"matchingScoreModifiers":["Not updated recently"],"popularity":-0.024,"topicSearchString":"react-native","matchScore":10,"category":["storage"],"uniqueCategory":"shared-group-preferences"},"https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist":{"githubUrl":"https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist","ios":true,"android":true,"expoGo":true,"github":{"urls":{"repo":"https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist","clone":"https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist.git","homepage":null},"stats":{"hasIssues":true,"hasWiki":true,"hasPages":false,"hasDownloads":true,"hasTopics":true,"updatedAt":"2021-10-24T01:11:37Z","createdAt":"2015-07-23T04:43:58Z","pushedAt":"2021-10-24T01:11:37Z","forks":837,"issues":516,"subscribers":85,"stars":12878},"name":"redux-persist","fullName":"rt2zz/redux-persist","description":"persist and rehydrate a redux store","topics":["persistor","storage","redux","redux-middleware"],"license":{"key":"mit","name":"MIT License","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz"},"lastRelease":{"name":"","tagName":"v6.0.0","createdAt":"2019-09-02T00:39:12Z","publishedAt":"2019-09-02T00:41:59Z","isPrerelease":false},"hasTypes":true,"newArchitecture":false},"images":[],"npmPkg":"redux-persist","npm":{"downloads":4275585,"start":"2024-04-24","end":"2024-05-23","period":"month","weekDownloads":993867},"score":56,"matchingScoreModifiers":["Very popular","Popular","Lots of open issues","Not updated recently"],"popularity":-0.018,"topicSearchString":"persistor storage redux redux-middleware","matchScore":1,"category":["storage"],"uniqueCategory":"state-management"},"https://github.com/MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking":{"githubUrl":"https://github.com/MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking","examples":["https://github.com/MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking/tree/main/example"],"ios":true,"android":true,"expoGo":true,"github":{"urls":{"repo":"https://github.com/MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking","clone":"https://github.com/MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking.git","homepage":null},"stats":{"hasIssues":true,"hasWiki":true,"hasPages":false,"hasDownloads":true,"hasTopics":true,"updatedAt":"2023-03-24T21:31:58Z","createdAt":"2022-08-21T19:30:18Z","pushedAt":"2023-03-24T21:31:58Z","forks":0,"issues":0,"subscribers":3,"stars":16},"name":"react-native-components-tracking","fullName":"MetaLabs-inc/react-native-components-tracking","description":"React Native library to automatically track events on several componentes","topics":["react-native","ios","android"],"license":{"key":"mit","name":"MIT License","spdxId":"MIT","url":"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/","id":"MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz"},"lastRelease":{"name":"Release 1.1.2","tagName":"v1.1.2","createdAt":"2023-03-24T21:32:39Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-25T17:37:14Z","isPrerelease":false},"hasTypes":true,"newArchitecture":false},"images":[],"npmPkg":"react-native-components-tracking","npm":{"downloads":88,"start":"2024-04-24","end":"2024-05-23","period":"month","weekDownloads":20},"score":38,"matchingScoreModifiers":["Not updated recently"],"popularity":-0.573,"topicSearchString":"react-native ios android","matchScore":100,"category":["react-native-component"],"uniqueCategory":"analytics"},"https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native":{"githubUrl":"https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native","images":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/master/screenshots/readme/cover.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/master/screenshots/1.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/master/screenshots/2.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/master/screenshots/3.png"],"ios":true,"android":true,"expoGo":true,"github":{"urls":{"repo":"https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native","clone":"https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native.git","homepage":"https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react-native/"},"stats":{"hasIssues":true,"hasWiki":true,"hasPages":true,"hasDownloads":true,"hasTopics":true,"updatedAt":"2024-05-23T10:03:58Z","createdAt":"2019-03-28T08:50:26Z","pushedAt":"2024-05-23T10:03:58Z","forks":303,"issues":26,"subscribers":39,"stars":921},"name":"stream-chat-react-native","fullName":"GetStream/stream-chat-react-native","description":" \ud83d\udcac React-Native Chat SDK \u279c Stream Chat.
